## Description

A full Stack Application that allows the user to search for products from an online store, and using Stripe, to buy them. It is running a GraphQL and Apollo back-end and a React-Redux front-end.

## User Story

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider

WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
